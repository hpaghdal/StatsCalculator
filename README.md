## Program Outline: 

## 1. Main object

* Calculator Object - Demonstrate inheritance by extending the calculator
    * Static Methods
        * Addition: Calls addition static method from math operations
        * Subtraction: Calls Subtraction static method from math operations
        * Multiplication: Calls Multiplication static method from math operations
        * Division: Calls Division static method from math operations
        * Square: Calls Square static method from math operations
        * Square root: Calls Square root static method from math operations

## 2. Basic Math Operations (Static methods)

* Addition
        * Sum 2 numbers
        * Sum List of numbers
        
* Subtraction
        * Subtract 1 number by another number

* Multiplication
        * Multiply 1 number by another number

* Division
        * Divide 1 number by another number

* Square
        * Calculate the square of number

* Square root
        * Calculate the square root of number


## 3. Random Number Generator
